# Sovereign.OS Launch Acceptance Record

Status: current launch record. Authoritative post-launch evidence for the accepted production release. The executing release path for the current production SHA is browser-audited (`pnpm production:release:oauth`), which runs the text-first gates plus the two live Browser Rendering checks. Current live production SHA `c21eb46…` was converged by Cloudflare build-triggered deploys (push to `main` → `pnpm production:deploy`, the same browser-audited orchestrator); see the post-acceptance convergence subsection below.

## Authenticated E2E Production Smoke Test

```text
Authenticated E2E production smoke test:
BLOCKED — no authorized production test account/credentials available in this environment.
```

Already verified:

```text
Source certification:            PASS
Deployment certification:        PASS
Production readiness:            PASS
Authentication boundary:         PASS
Authenticated intelligence E2E:  NOT VERIFIED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
```

The authenticated path (session → workspace → Baseline → Expression Field → intelligence → sovereign-answer.v2 → persistence) is fully implemented and passes local integration tests. Production exercise requires an authorized test account with an active session.

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Identify last known-good SHA

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Each production release records its exact SHA in D1 release evidence. The `/ready` endpoint exposes the currently deployed SHA. To find the last known-good release:

```bash
# Check production readiness to confirm current SHA
curl -sS https://sovereign.defrag.app/ready | jq '.sha'
```

### Revert to a known-good release

1. Check out the known-good SHA:

```bash
git checkout <known-good-sha>
```

2. Verify the SHA builds and passes gates:

```bash
pnpm verify:cloudflare-build
```

3. Deploy using the authoritative release path:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> pnpm production:release:text
```

Or via the OAuth release script:

```bash
bash scripts/production-release-oauth.sh
```

4. Confirm rollback:

```bash
curl -sS https://sovereign.defrag.app/ready | jq '{sha: .sha, ready: .ready, migration: .migrationVersion}'
```

### Migration compatibility

Worker rollback does not reverse D1 migrations. If the rolled-back code expects a schema that no longer exists, forward-repair migrations must be applied before rollback. The current schema (`0019_deprecate_manual_capacity`) is backward-compatible with all code since `0017`.

### What must NOT be manually changed during rollback

- Do not manually edit D1 data
- Do not manually modify Worker secrets via Cloudflare dashboard
- Do not manually alter Cloudflare route configurations
- Do not bypass the release orchestrator with ad-hoc `wrangler deploy`
- All changes go through the canonical release path

---

## Next Release Path

```text
develop/change
    ↓
pnpm verify:cloudflare-build
    ↓
pnpm production:release:text
    ↓
deploy (single wrangler deploy)
    ↓
readiness (both branded /ready endpoints)
    ↓
SHA reconciliation (GitHub = Cloudflare = /ready)
    ↓
smoke verification
```

### Exact commands

```bash
# 1. Verify source
pnpm verify:cloudflare-build

# 2. Deploy (same SHA only)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> pnpm production:release:text

# 3. Verify production
curl -sS https://sovereign.defrag.app/ready | jq '.sha, .ready'
curl -sS https://app.defrag.app/ready | jq '.sha, .ready'
```

### Cloudflare authentication

Wrangler OAuth is the canonical credential. Extract the OAuth token for script use:

```bash
wrangler login
wrangler auth token --json
```

Do not print, commit, log, or expose the token.

### Release invariants

- Run `pnpm production:release:text` only for the **same exact SHA** that passed `pnpm verify:cloudflare-build`
- The release orchestrator asserts SHA parity, applies migrations, deploys exactly once, writes release evidence, and converges readiness
- A preparation, migration, secret, Cloudflare-control, or DMARC failure before `wrangler deploy` performs zero deployments
- A failure after `wrangler deploy` is one deployment and must be diagnosed before another release attempt

---

## Operational Guardrails

### Source parity

```text
GitHub SHA = release SHA
```

Enforced by `scripts/assert-main-release.mjs`. The release command rejects drift between the local checkout and `origin/main`.

### Deployment parity

```text
release SHA = Cloudflare deployed SHA
```

Enforced by the release orchestrator's single `wrangler deploy` and post-deploy verification.

### Runtime parity

```text
Cloudflare deployed SHA = /ready SHA
```

Verified by the release orchestrator's convergence step across both branded domains.

### Migration parity

```text
source migration = production migration
```

Verified by `pnpm verify:migrations` (pre-deploy) and `/ready` response (post-deploy).

### Release acceptance

A successful build alone does not constitute launch acceptance.

A healthy production endpoint alone does not constitute product certification.

Both are required. Source certification, deployment certification, and product certification are separate states that must all be satisfied.

---

## Evidence Retention

Keep, as applicable:

- Exact `origin/main` SHA and exact deployed SHA
- `pnpm verify:cloudflare-build` result for that SHA
- One-deploy production result
- `/health` and `/ready` evidence from both branded domains
- Migration, privacy dependency, and release-evidence parity
- The explicit release-evidence route/rendered booleans
- Sanitized Cloudflare control/deployment metadata
- Real authenticated product-journey evidence (when available)
- Human desktop/iPhone screenshots when privacy-safe
- Optional Browser Rendering reports only when actually run

| Change | Mobile landing-page product-proof panel readability: increased message text from .74rem to .82rem, adjusted padding/gap, removed forced min-height on workflow items, increased CSS selector specificity to win cascade |
| Evidence | Playwright headless Chromium rendered at 375/390/393/430/1024/1280/1440px — all 21 data points (7 viewports × 3 stories) pass |
| Tests | 684/684 pass |
| Typecheck | 9/9 pass |
| Build | pass |
| Deploy | `pnpm production:release:text` — success |

SHA parity for `f12e73f`:

```text
HEAD       = f12e73fefdadc8d30aeb1d1cc29c8896a07708cd
origin     = f12e73fefdadc8d30aeb1d1cc29c8896a07708cd
Cloudflare = f12e73fefdadc8d30aeb1d1cc29c8896a07708cd
/ready     = f12e73fefdadc8d30aeb1d1cc29c8896a07708cd
```

Desktop regression: none (1024/1280/1440px computed styles identical to prior release).

### Release Impact

```text
MOBILE PROOF-PANEL READABILITY IMPROVEMENT
```

CSS cascade conflict discovered: mobile rules from `production-visual-authority-v1.css` were being overridden by higher-specificity rules from other CSS files. Fixed by increasing selector specificity (`html .public-approved-v8` prefix) to match competing rules. Verified via Playwright computed-style extraction that intended values now render at all mobile viewports. Desktop unaffected.

## Post-Launch Acceptance — Browser-Audited Release (2026-08-27)

Production SHA `1f31416eb5575e9fe99e6197823d775131449410` was the accepted production release at execution time (superseded by the `5329cac…` post-launch convergence documented below).

### Execution record

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Production SHA | `1f31416eb5575e9fe99e6197823d775131449410` |
| Migration | `0019_deprecate_manual_capacity` |
| Migration parity | `current` |
| Deploy | #1346 — Worker version `b860ab37`, source `wrangler`, author `defragapp@gmail.com`, 2026-08-27T16:54:14Z |
| Release path | `pnpm production:release:oauth` — browser-audited orchestrator (`scripts/cloudflare-production-release.mjs` with the full `DEFAULT_POST_DEPLOY_CHECKS`) |
| D1 release evidence | written 2026-08-27T17:00:50Z — `status: success`, `routeCohesionVerified: true`, `renderedVisualVerified: true`, `dmarcVerified: true` |
| Routes | `sovereign.defrag.app`, `app.defrag.app`, `defrag.app`, `www.defrag.app` — all `/ready` = `1f31416…`, `ready: true`, migration `0018`/`current` |
| Answer contract | `sovereign-answer.v2` |
| Baseline contract | `baseline-source.v1+baseline-facets.v1` |
| Integrity flag | RESOLVED — booleans earned by genuine Browser Rendering execution |

### Integrity-flag resolution

The D1 `release_evidence` history establishes the execution pattern and truthfulness:

- 2026-08-25 releases (`44b7f94`, `eea6cf0`, `f12e73f`) — text-first path, browser checks excluded: `routeCohesionVerified: false`, `renderedVisualVerified: false`.
- 2026-08-26 (`0cc178d`) and 2026-08-27 (`1f31416…`) — browser-audited orchestrator: both booleans `true`.

Corroboration: Cloudflare deployments API (`source: wrangler`, `author: defragapp@gmail.com`, 2026-08-27T16:54:14Z); wrangler OAuth session timeline (16:23Z auth → 16:49–16:52Z prep → 16:54Z deploy → 17:00:50Z evidence); local `agent=opencode` wrangler logs; shell history showing the orchestrator command with an OAuth token exported. A direct D1 read confirms the `1f31416…` evidence row with `status: success` and both booleans `true`.

### Acceptance decision

The browser-audited path is a strict superset of the text-first path: it runs everything the text-first path runs plus the two live Browser Rendering checks (route cohesion and rendered page-family audit). Because the frozen candidate `1f31416…` is unchanged regardless of the executing path, and the browser-audited path produced strictly more evidence, the release is **accepted under the browser-audited scope**. This replaces the minimum text-first scope declared at launch and is consistent with `docs/launch-product-contract.md`, which permits `pnpm production:release:oauth` as an optional Browser-audited release path.

Human desktop/iPhone review and the authenticated product journey remain operator-owned acceptance items (see the checklist below).

### Post-acceptance convergence (2026-08-27 18:43Z)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Current production SHA | `c21eb46a72ef26cc43aabac95f7b0798a6881975` |
| Prior convergence SHA | `5329cac6c37609ede23f428640e6430832b3ad95` (docs-only, code identical) |
| Prior accepted SHA | `1f31416eb5575e9fe99e6197823d775131449410` (code identical) |
| Code difference | none across `1f31416 → 5329cac → c21eb46` beyond the launch record itself |
| Trigger | Cloudflare build on push to `main` (repo `defragapp/OPENAPI`, branch `main`) |
| Build | verified `pnpm verify:cloudflare-build` (all stages pass; main-release guard `metadata=cloudflare`) |
| Deploy command | `pnpm production:deploy` = `assert-main-release.mjs` → `cloudflare-production-release.mjs` (browser-audited) → `verify-parent-domain-routes.mjs` |
| Deploy (`5329cac…`) | #1347 — 2026-08-27T18:43:59Z, `APP_VERSION=5329cac…` |
| Deploy (`c21eb46…`) | record push — 2026-08-27 evening, `APP_VERSION=c21eb46…`; `/ready` converged on both branded domains |
| D1 release evidence | written for `5329cac…` 2026-08-27T18:50:28Z — `routeCohesionVerified: true`, `renderedVisualVerified: true`, `dmarcVerified: true`, converged; the record push wrote a matching row for `c21eb46…` through the same orchestrator |
| Live verification | both branded `/ready` = `c21eb46…`, `ready: true`, migration `0019_deprecate_manual_capacity`, parity `current` |

Decision: `c21eb46…` is **accepted as the current production SHA** under the browser-audited scope. The build-triggered deploys ran the identical orchestrator, produced truthful D1 evidence, and restored the canonical steady state (`production == current origin/main`). `1f31416…` and `5329cac…` remain the prior operator-initiated and prior converged releases, all with identical product code.

Operational note: any push to `main` triggers a production build+deploy via the external Cloudflare build trigger. To change the record without a redeploy, pause production deployments on the connected build project first (or push on a branch without a production trigger); otherwise each pushed commit becomes a new live `APP_VERSION`.

### Requires Human Acceptance

| Item | Status | Owner Action |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Authenticated real-user journey | EVIDENCE PENDING | Exercise the full first-user path with a real test account |
| Desktop interaction review | EVIDENCE PENDING | Review live app in desktop browser |
| iPhone interaction review | EVIDENCE PENDING | Review live app on iPhone/Safari |
| Owner acceptance of product messaging/experience | EVIDENCE PENDING | Review and accept the overall product experience |

### How to Close These Gaps

When an authorized production test account is available:

```text
landing → authentication → account/session → baseline → workspace
→ first question → Sovereign Answer → follow-up → persistence
```

Then test one representative Relationship or System journey.

Record only: journey completed, success/failure, route, contract status, persistence result, release SHA.

On desktop and iPhone, review:

```text
landing page — authentication — onboarding — workspace — composer
— answer rendering — navigation — error/loading states — responsive behavior
— typography — spacing — information hierarchy
```

Classify any issues found:

```text
BLOCKING        — prevents user from completing core journey
NON-BLOCKING    — cosmetic or minor, does not block acceptance
ACCEPTED        — known, intentional, or within product direction
```
