This manual documents the operational procedures for maintaining Sovereign.OS production infrastructure.

## Production identity

| Element | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `defragapp/OPENAPI` |
| Branch | `main` (single canonical branch) |
| Current SHA | `e2e7c2389dafa4621632db0dede9964d6ac80d08` |
| Worker name | `sovv-web` |
| Public site | `https://sovereign.defrag.app` |
| Authenticated app | `https://app.defrag.app` |
| Root domain | `defrag.app` |
| D1 database | `sovereign-openapi-db` |
| Durable Object | `ThreadCoordinator` |
| AI model | `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash` |
| AI Gateway | `sovereign-ai-gateway` |
| Release tag | `release-certified-baseline` |

## GitHub operations

### Branch protection recommendations

| Setting | Recommended value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Require pull request | Not required (single operator) | Current workflow is direct-to-main |
| Require status checks | `pnpm verify:cloudflare-build` | Prevent broken deploys |
| Require signed commits | Recommended | Prevent unauthorized commits |
| Restrict force pushes | Always | Protect history |
| Allow deletions | Never | Protect main branch |
| Require linear history | Recommended | Clean commit history |

### Release tags

| Tag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `release-v1.0.0` | Initial release marker |
| `release-certified-baseline` | Current production certification |
| `release-certified-baseline-59225c6` | SHA-specific certification |

### Release process

```bash
# 1. Confirm on main at current origin/main
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# 2. Run full repository gate
pnpm verify:cloudflare-build

# 3. Release same SHA to production
pnpm production:release:text

# 4. Verify both domains converge
curl -s https://sovereign.defrag.app/ready | jq .
curl -s https://app.defrag.app/ready | jq .
```

### Untracked production-impacting files

Current untracked items (not production-impacting):
- `FINAL_OUTCOME_CERTIFICATION.md` — audit document
- `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_REPORT.md` — audit document
- `scripts/live-answer-probe/` — audit scripts
- `visual-inspection/` — audit artifacts

These are documentation/audit artifacts, not production-impacting code.

## Cloudflare operations

### Workers deployment

| Check | Method | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployed SHA | `GET /ready` | Matches release SHA |
| Routes correct | Route cohort verification | All SPA + API routes resolve |
| Domains correct | DNS verification | sovereign.defrag.app, app.defrag.app |
| Worker status | Cloudflare dashboard | Active, no errors |

### Rollback procedure

1. Identify the previously stable deployment version
2. Use Cloudflare dashboard → Workers → sovv-web → Deployments
3. Roll back to the previous deployment
4. Verify `/ready` on both domains
5. **Note**: Rollback does NOT reverse D1 migrations, Stripe events, or email delivery

**Forward-repair is preferred over rollback.** Use migrations to fix forward when possible.

### D1 operations

| Operation | Method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Migration application | `pnpm production:release:text` (automatic) | Applied before deploy |
| Migration verification | `GET /ready` → `migrationVersion` | Must be `0019_deprecate_manual_capacity` |
| Migration parity | `GET /ready` → `dependencies.migrationParity` | Must be `current` |
| Backup/recovery | Cloudflare D1 automatic backups | Verify backup schedule in dashboard |
| Direct queries | `wrangler d1 execute sovereign-openapi-db` | Use read-replica when possible |

**D1 recovery plan**:
1. D1 maintains automatic backups (verify schedule in Cloudflare dashboard)
2. Point-in-time recovery available through Cloudflare
3. Application-level data can be reconstructed from D1 state + Stripe events
4. No R2 backup dependency (R2 is disabled)

### Durable Object operations

| Check | Method | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ThreadCoordinator active | `GET /ready` → `dependencies.durableObjects` | `configured` |
| Turn coordination | Integration tests | Serialize concurrent turns |
| Persistence | DO storage | Bounded to thread workflow |

### AI Gateway configuration

| Setting | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway ID | `sovereign-ai-gateway` | `wrangler.jsonc` |
| Model | `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash` | `wrangler.jsonc` |
| Provider gate | `cloudflare-gateway` only | `agent/sovereign.ts` |
| Free turns | 10/month | `AI_FREE_MONTHLY_TURNS` |
| Plus turns | 300/month | `AI_SOVEREIGN_PLUS_MONTHLY_TURNS` |
| Capacity ledger | Daily tracking | Migration `0013` |

### Rate limits and protection

| Control | Implementation | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth rate limit | 2-min per-email, 10 per-IP per 15-min | `auth-public.ts` |
| Turnstile | Required at signup/login | `auth-public.ts` |
| Input size limit | 8000 chars | `agent/safety.ts` |
| Cloudflare WAF | Free-tier configuration | `configure-cloudflare-free-tier.mjs` |
| API Shield | Endpoint Management templates | Release reconciler |
| Bot protection | Cloudflare bot management | Zone-level configuration |
| DDoS protection | Cloudflare automatic | Zone-level |

### Scheduled jobs

| Schedule | Job | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `*/15 * * * *` | `runDueJobs` | Process deletion, cleanup, invitation expiry |

## Monitoring and observability

### Health endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Basic health | `ok`, `sha`, `migrationVersion`, `dependencies` |
| `GET /healthz` | Alias | Same as `/health` |
| `GET /ready` | Full readiness | `ready`, all dependencies, release evidence |

### Observability configuration

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Logs enabled | Yes |
| Invocation logs | Yes |
| Traces enabled | Yes |
| Trace sampling | 5% (`head_sampling_rate: 0.05`) |

### Release evidence verification

After each release, verify:
1. Both `/ready` endpoints report exact target SHA
2. `ready: true` on both domains
3. `migrationVersion: 0019_deprecate_manual_capacity`
4. `migrationParity: current`
5. `policyAcceptanceReceipts: configured`
6. `privacyAccessControls: configured`
7. DMARC evidence verified

## Required production secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Rotation procedure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SESSION_SIGNING_SECRET` | HMAC session tokens | `docs/security/credential-rotation-runbook.md` |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Turnstile verification | Same |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Transactional email | Same |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Payment processing | Same |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook verification | Same |
| `RELEASE_EVIDENCE_SECRET` | Authenticates `POST /internal/release-evidence` writes (public SHA alone is rejected) | Same |

**Never** copy secret values into repository files, build output, issues, screenshots, or logs.

## Emergency procedures

### Service degradation

| Symptom | Check | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/health` returns `ok: false` | D1 connectivity | Check D1 status in Cloudflare dashboard |
| `/ready` returns `ready: false` | Dependencies | Check each dependency status |
| AI failures | AI Gateway | Check Cloudflare AI status; capacity ledger |
| Auth failures | Turnstile/Resend | Check provider status |
| Payment failures | Stripe | Check webhook delivery; signature verification |

### Incident response

Follow `docs/security/incident-response-runbook.md`:
1. Contain
2. Preserve evidence
3. Assess scope
4. Eradicate and recover
5. Notify appropriately
6. Close and improve

### Rollback decision criteria

Rollback when:
- Critical security vulnerability in deployed code
- Data corruption detected
- Service completely unavailable and forward-repair is not viable

Rollback is NOT appropriate when:
- Forward-fix migration can resolve the issue
- Issue is in external provider (Cloudflare, Stripe, Resend)
- Issue is cosmetic/non-functional

## Source evidence

## AI Gateway failure runbook

### Overview

The AI Gateway (`sovereign-ai-gateway` with model `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash`) is the single AI provider for Sovereign.OS. If it becomes unavailable, the system must gracefully degrade without consuming user capacity.

### Failure detection

| Signal | Detection method | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI Gateway unavailable | `aiDependencyStatus()` returns `'missing'` | Immediate |
| Request timeout | 60s gateway timeout (`GATEWAY_ANSWER_TIMEOUT_MS`) | Per request |
| Capacity exhausted | 429 from gateway / `RETRY_AFTER` header | Per request |
| Model error | Non-2xx response | Per request |

### Deterministic fallback behavior

When AI Gateway is unavailable or returns an error:

1. **Capacity refund**: `releaseAiTurn()` is called automatically in catch block
2. **No capacity consumed**: Turn is marked `failed` with `recognition_failed` status
3. **User-facing response**: Generic `answer_service_unavailable` error (503)
4. **User message**: "Sovereign is temporarily unavailable. Your private conversation and Baseline remain unchanged, and no answer was generated."
5. **Retryable**: Yes (`retryable: true`, `nextAction: "retry_message"`)

### User-facing fallback behavior

**Current implementation** (`entry.ts:476-484`):
```json
{
  "type": "https://sovereign.defrag.app/problems/answer-service-unavailable",
  "error": "answer_service_unavailable",
  "message": "Sovereign is temporarily unavailable. Your private conversation and Baseline remain unchanged, and no answer was generated.",
  "nextAction": "retry_message",
  "retryable": true
}
```

**Future enhancement** (documented for future implementation):
- Add user-facing status banner when AI Gateway is degraded
- Expose estimated recovery time when available from Cloudflare status
- Provide "Retry" button that re-sends the message

### Operator actions

| Scenario | Detection | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway 503/429 | `/ready` shows `ai: "missing"` or `aiGateway: "missing"` | Check Cloudflare status page; wait for recovery |
| Gateway timeout | Requests taking >60s | Check Cloudflare AI status page; consider manual failover if available |
| Capacity ledger full | `/ready` shows `aiFreeCapacity: "missing"` | Wait for daily reset (UTC midnight); monitor `workers_ai_daily_capacity` table |
| Model hallucination/quality | User reports | Disable model in AI Gateway config; report to Cloudflare |

### Capacity ledger monitoring

```bash
# Check current usage
wrangler d1 execute sovereign-openapi-db --remote --command "SELECT * FROM workers_ai_daily_capacity WHERE usage_day = date('now')"

# Check recent failures
wrangler d1 execute sovereign-openapi-db --remote --command "SELECT * FROM threads WHERE status = 'failed' AND created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour')"
```

### Staging test procedure

1. Deploy to staging with AI Gateway enabled
2. Disable AI Gateway in Cloudflare dashboard
3. Send a test question from staging
3. Verify:
   - Response is 503 with `answer_service_unavailable`
   - `Retry-After` header present
   - Turn is refunded (capacity ledger released)
   - No user data exposed in error
4. Re-enable AI Gateway
5. Verify normal operation restored

### Decision criteria for manual failover

**Do NOT manually failover** if:
- Cloudflare status page shows ongoing incident
- Failure is intermittent (< 5 minutes)
- Capacity ledger shows available capacity

**Consider manual intervention** if:
- Cloudflare confirms extended outage (> 30 min)
- Business impact is critical (e.g., launch day)
- Alternative model available in Cloudflare AI Gateway

**Manual failover steps** (if available):
1. Update AI Gateway config to use fallback model
2. Update `wrangler.jsonc` `AI_MODEL` if model change needed
3. Re-run `pnpm production:release:text`
4. Verify `/ready` shows `ai: "configured"`

### Post-incident review

Required within 48 hours:
1. Timeline of events
2. Root cause (Cloudflare status, capacity, model issue)
3. User impact assessment (failed requests, affected users)
4. Runbook effectiveness
5. Action items for prevention
