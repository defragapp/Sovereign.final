## 7. Business and Entitlements
- **Pricing and Plans**: See the authoritative terms in [Launch Product Contract](launch-product-contract.md#free-access-billing-and-voluntary-support)
  - Free: $0, 10 Sovereign AI turns per UTC month
  - Sovereign+: $20 monthly or $99 annually, 300 turns per UTC month
  - People, Systems, Library continuity, Covenant, and consent-aware shared intelligence are Sovereign+ capabilities under server enforcement
- **Entitlement/Authorization Rules**: Enforced server-side; Stripe Checkout/Portal/webhooks are authoritative (see [launch-product-contract.md](launch-product-contract.md#free-access-billing-and-voluntary-support)).

## 8. Acceptance and Launch Ledger
- **Acceptance Requirements**: See [Release Gates](release-gates.md) and [Production Release Procedure](production-release.md).
- **Launch Ledger**: The current GREEN/FIXED/BLOCKED/REMAINING state and live evidence are tracked in the repository root file: [../SPRINT_ACCEPTANCE.md](../SPRINT_ACCEPTANCE.md).

## 9. Known External Blockers (Reference)
- Preview-host access needed for full authenticated journey (verify current status before execution).
- Operational Stripe secret required for real Checkout/Portal flows (do not write secrets to the repo).
- Treat these as environment requirements; do not rewrite application architecture to bypass them.
