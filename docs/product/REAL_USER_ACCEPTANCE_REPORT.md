# Real User Acceptance Report

Status: end-to-end user journey verification

Reviewed: 2026-08-29

Live funnel session: 2026-08-29 (real browser, real Turnstile solve, real mailbox) — see "Live signup funnel session" below.

Post-release re-run: 2026-08-29, after the sovereign.os identity release (SHA `5df75dd7`): both branded `/ready` endpoints `ready: true` (live: `publicContactEmail: info@sovereign.os`), and two fresh real-Turnstile signup attempts reproduced the same owner-gated delivery boundary (`resend_403_The sovereign.defrag.app domain is not verified` in worker tail; 503, no account created).

This report verifies that a real human can use Sovereign.OS end-to-end, from discovery through daily use. Verification is based on source-code audit and live production probing.

## Gaps requiring owner action

The following verifications require a live user session and cannot be completed by source audit alone:

| Gap | Required action |
| --- | --- |
| Complete signup with valid email | Owner must create test account |
| Complete Baseline creation | Owner must enter birth data |
| Receive first intelligence answer | Owner must ask a question |
| Test Stripe checkout with real card | Owner must initiate checkout (can cancel) |
| Test email delivery | Owner must verify magic link arrives |
| Mobile visual QA | Owner must verify on iPhone/Android |
| Passkey enrollment | Owner must test WebAuthn flow |

## Live signup funnel session — 2026-08-29

Harness: `visual-inspection/signup-funnel.mjs` (Playwright, headed Chromium, disposable Guerrilla Mail inbox). Evidence screenshots in the session log; worker behavior confirmed via `wrangler tail sovv-web`.

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Production signup page renders | VERIFIED — founder visual system intact at 1280×800 |
| Turnstile widget renders | VERIFIED — managed widget, interactive checkbox (no headless auto-pass) |
| Real Turnstile solve → widget token | VERIFIED — caption "Security check complete.", submit enabled |
| Server accepts real token | VERIFIED — request passed `verifyTurnstile` and reached email delivery |
| Email delivery | **FAILED — production blocker** `resend_403_The sovereign.defrag.app domain is not verified.` observed live in worker tail (`email_delivery_failed`) |
| Fail-closed behavior | VERIFIED — 503 `Email delivery unavailable`, UI: "No account change was made", no magic link row consumed |

Post-release re-run (same day, after the sovereign.os identity release, SHA `5df75dd7`): identical outcome — real Turnstile solve accepted, `resend_403_The sovereign.defrag.app domain is not verified` in worker tail, 503 fail-closed, no account created. The sovereign.os identity change did not alter the delivery boundary; the Resend domain verification remains the sole blocker.

### Repairs applied this session

1. **P0-001 Turnstile (RESOLVED):** production `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` on worker `sovv-web` returned `invalid-input-secret`. The secret was reconciled to the exact value of Turnstile widget `0x4AAAAAADhGIF8-iOLIg8MU` via the Cloudflare API (`GET /accounts/8b1954…/challenges/widgets/…`) using the owner's authenticated session; the value was piped directly into the worker secret store and never exposed. Live proof: bogus-token signup/login probes now return 400 `invalid` (siteverify accepts the secret, rejects only the token); both branded `/ready` endpoints remain `ready: true` at the deployed SHA with migration parity current.
2. **P0-002 Email domain (BLOCKED — owner action):** production Resend sends must originate from a verified domain. The public contact identity is now `info@sovereign.os` (`PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`, pinned by `scripts/verify-public-contact.mjs` as the approved public contact), while the transactional sender and reply-to remain pinned to the deliverable operational address `info@sovereign.defrag.app` (`TRANSACTIONAL_FROM_EMAIL` / `TRANSACTIONAL_REPLY_TO_EMAIL`). Delivery still transmits through the `sovereign.defrag.app` sending domain, which was never added/verified in the Resend account. The apex `defrag.app` is verified in Resend but is a **prohibited** sender per the same verifier, so no code or config override may substitute it. Live proof (2026-08-29, post-release): worker tail captured `resend_403_The sovereign.defrag.app domain is not verified` during two fresh real-Turnstile signup attempts; each returned 503 `Email delivery unavailable` with the UI fail-closed message and no account created.

### Required owner actions to unblock signup delivery

Context: the production `RESEND_API_KEY` exists only as an unreadable worker secret; no Resend credential capable of adding a domain exists in this environment, and the Cloudflare email binding cannot absorb Resend failures by design (`email.ts` provider priority). The domain step therefore requires Resend dashboard access.

1. Resend dashboard → Domains → Add `sovereign.defrag.app`.
2. Add the DNS records Resend presents for the subdomain (two DKIM TXT records at `resend._domainkey.sovereign.defrag.app`, SPF TXT at `send.sovereign.defrag.app` — pattern identical to the already-verified apex records).
3. Wait for Resend to mark the domain Verified, then rerun `node visual-inspection/signup-funnel.mjs` — the funnel resumes automatically at real email delivery, magic-link redeem, and onboarding.

These are documented as GitHub issues #210–#216 in the product acceptance task graph; this session adds the delivery-domain blocker to that list.

## Verdict

**All source-verifiable user journey steps PASS.** The remaining gaps require live human testing, which is tracked in the product acceptance task graph and documented in `FINAL_LIVE_USER_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
