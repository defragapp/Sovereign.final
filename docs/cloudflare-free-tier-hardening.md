Do not replace production names with placeholders or create alternate data paths.

## Production authority

For the current text-first launch:

```bash
pnpm verify:cloudflare-build
pnpm production:release:text
```

The release command must target the same exact current `origin/main` SHA that passed the full deterministic gate. It performs one deploy and intentionally excludes live Browser Rendering.

`pnpm production:release:oauth` remains an optional Browser-audited path when explicitly requested. Historical Workers Builds triggers/build tokens, GitHub Actions, deploy hooks, Pages, preview Workers, duplicate production Workers, and alternate repositories are outside production authority.

See `docs/production-release.md` for exact sequencing and release-evidence semantics.

## Production release control sequence

The text-first release path:

1. rejects a checkout that does not match exact current `origin/main`;
2. verifies migrations/release configuration;
3. verifies the publicly served DMARC record;
4. resolves the existing production D1 database and prepares the exact production config;
5. applies migrations through `0019_deprecate_manual_capacity`;
6. verifies required Worker secrets;
7. configures/verifies the Free-plan controls below;
8. deploys exactly one `sovv-web` version;
9. verifies parent-domain/runtime and secondary public routes without Browser Rendering;
10. writes exact-SHA release evidence and converges it across both branded domains.

A credential must support all operations the repository owns. A Worker upload succeeding does not prove release completion if route/control reconciliation fails afterward.

## D1 Sessions and read replication

The Worker uses request-scoped `DB.withSession(...)` connections for `/api/*` requests.

1. Requests without a bookmark begin with `first-primary`.
2. The Worker returns the latest opaque D1 bookmark after a query.
3. The browser stores it in session storage.
4. Later same-origin API calls return the bookmark.
5. Invalid/oversized/control-character values are ignored.
6. The bookmark is cleared on logout.
7. Requests producing no bookmark continue normally.

The bookmark is a consistency marker, not an authentication credential. Authentication remains the signed, revocable `__Host-sovereign_session` cookie.

Production read replication remains `auto` on the existing `sovereign-openapi-db`. The release path never creates a replacement database merely to enable replication.

## Free Workers AI inference

Production and preview use `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash` through the Cloudflare AI binding/Gateway.

Every personalized call enforces:

- `skipCache: true`;
- `collectLog: false`;
- structured JSON response mode;
- low-temperature structured generation;
- `sovereign-answer.v2` validation;
- authorized answer mode and Basis references;
- Covenant grounding where explicitly enabled;
- output-safety review.

The current product is text-first; no video-provider budget or generated-media path is part of this Free-tier launch architecture.

## Global daily capacity

Migration `0013_workers_ai_free_capacity` creates the D1 ledger `workers_ai_daily_capacity`.

Sovereign reserves conservatively below the account-level Workers AI allocation. Before a hosted-model call, the Worker atomically reserves estimated capacity. Source-level model failure releases the reservation. If internal capacity is unavailable, Sovereign returns a controlled capacity response and does not guess or save an invented answer.

A failed generation also releases the user’s monthly reservation where the current product contract requires it.

## Monthly account allowances

- Free: 10 Sovereign turns per UTC month.
- Sovereign+: 300 Sovereign turns per UTC month.

Monthly plan access is server-derived. The browser cannot self-declare Sovereign+.

## AI Gateway

The production control script verifies the existing `sovereign-ai-gateway` configuration, including:

- bounded account-wide rate limiting;
- cache TTL zero for the configured path;
- persistent request-content logging disabled.

No paid video-model spend guard is required for the current launch because video generation is not activated.

## Zone rate limiting

The repository owns one Free-plan zone rate-limit rule for matching thread-message paths:

- path: `/api/v1/threads/*/messages`;
- expression fields: Free-plan-compatible path fields only;
- characteristic: source IP and Cloudflare data center;
- limit: 10 matching requests per 10 seconds;
- mitigation: block for 10 seconds.

The release script identifies its own rule before updating it. If an unrelated rule occupies the one available Free-plan rate-limit slot, release preparation stops rather than silently deleting or replacing that rule.

## API Shield and Endpoint Management

`docs/api-shield/sovereign-critical-api.openapi.yaml` covers security-sensitive mutation bodies for account onboarding, current-condition settings, person/invitation consent, Stripe Checkout/Portal, and account deletion approval.

Turnstile-bearing authentication requests are intentionally excluded from blocking request-body schema validation because the Free plan has a limited body-inspection window. Authentication remains protected by Turnstile, origin checks, rate limits, input limits, one-time credentials, signed cookies, and D1 revocation.

The release control path:

1. owns only the schema named for the Sovereign.OS critical API;
2. ensures required operations exist in Endpoint Management;
3. enables the intended schema validation behavior;
4. re-reads schema/operations/settings before deployment proceeds.

Cloudflare Endpoint Management may normalize named OpenAPI path parameters such as `{personId}` and `{scope}` into positional templates such as `{var1}` and `{var2}`. The repository normalizes both expected and returned templates before comparison. This prevents false “missing operation” failures without weakening the actual route/method contract.

## Production credential expectation

The production Cloudflare credential must be able to complete the bounded repository-owned operations required by the release, including Worker deployment, D1 access/migrations, Worker secret inspection, AI Gateway/control reads/writes where applicable, API Shield/Endpoint Management reconciliation, and the owned zone rate-limit rule.

Do not treat a credential as sufficient merely because `wrangler deploy` can upload the Worker. Release preparation/control reconciliation is part of the same production authority and fails closed when required permissions are absent.

## Worker bundle budget

The Cloudflare Workers Free compressed upload limit remains 3 MiB. Sovereign.OS enforces a stricter internal budget of 2,500 KiB.

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm verify:worker-bundle-size
```

The verifier uses Wrangler dry-run output and parses the compressed upload measurement.

## Release evidence provenance

Automated Browser evidence is explicit:

- route-cohesion Browser audit actually passed → `routeCohesionVerified: true`;
- rendered-visual Browser audit actually passed → `renderedVisualVerified: true`;
- text-first release without Browser Rendering → both fields `false`.

Human desktop/iPhone QA is separate evidence and never changes those automated fields by itself.
